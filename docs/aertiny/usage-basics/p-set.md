# Set Proportional (kP)

## UI Setting

- Navigate to the **PID** menu section from the Main Menu
- Navigate to the **Proportional** menu
- Use the rotary knob to adjust the **P** value

## Usage Definition

In a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller, the "P" stands for Proportional. The Proportional component of the PID controller generates an output signal based on the difference between the desired setpoint and the current process variable. The P value, also known as the proportional gain, determines the strength of this response to the error signal.

Essentially, the P value dictates how aggressively the controller acts to reduce the error between the setpoint and the actual process variable. A higher P value means a stronger response to errors, potentially leading to quicker correction but also potentially increasing the risk of overshooting or oscillations in the system. Conversely, a lower P value might result in slower response times but could provide more stable control.

So, adjusting the P value allows operators to fine-tune the controller's behavior to achieve the desired balance between responsiveness and stability in the controlled system.
